# House-EDA-and-Price-Prediction-Model
This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling to predict house prices using the Kaggle "House Prices -Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset.

## Workflow
- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature selection based on correlation
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Training and comparison of multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation using cross-validation and Kaggle leaderboard score

The final model achieves a competitive Kaggle score and demonstrates practical techniques
for improving regression performance.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset
[Kaggle : House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## Evaluation Metric
